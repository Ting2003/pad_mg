1. Evenly distribute the power pads, compute the IR drop values for 
   DC.
2. Compute the power for each node, use P = VI. 
   These power are left for the device layer: 
	1). The value should be high, since most of 
		energy should be kept for device layer.
	2). The lower number represents high IR drop area. The 
		aim is to add power pad numbers to increase the P 
		in these area.
3. Use matlab to generate the view for initial IR drop and Power 
   distribution.
4. Use the ratio of IR drop to do the first step of power
   pad distribution.
